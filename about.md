Hello Internet, I am Atul. I work at WalmartLabs, Bangalore, India as a Software Engineer. I have started this blog as a way for me to share some of the programming concepts I have grasped over time. I love to teach stuff, some say I am good at explaining things. So there I go, explaining few things my way to you. Let me know if you like it or hate it. Have some feedback for me? Reach out to me [here](mailto:atulvermaonmail@gmail.com).
